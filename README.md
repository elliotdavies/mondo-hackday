## Scenario

_That's right, scenarios._ You're a manager of a small team, and your team need company cards for work expenses. You give them cards, and they start spending your company's money. But wait! How do you know what they're spending? What if they're slipping in an expensive coffee every morning for themselves, or taking their mum out for dinner every Thursday evening (sweet, but not cool)?

You could go to your bank, ask for statements for all your team members and spend hours trawling through them all. You might even have a system for automatic tracking of their spending already, but damn, you probably have to boot up the old Windows machine in the corner of the office that runs IE6, just to access the interface that hasn't been updated since the marquee tag was cool.
